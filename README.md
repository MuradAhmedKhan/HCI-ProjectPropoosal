## Abstract ##

Recent years, several researchers are developing different kinds of assistive devices for physically disabled peoples.In this work, movement of illuminant markers through facial expressions is used to control the cursor movement in computer applications. The interface detects eye movements and interprets them as cursor control commands.
## Missions ##

*Make easy to use for physically disabled pereson.



## Domain Description ##
 
The domain at which we will be working is **Special Needs**. The reason behind selecting this domain is because this interface detects user's face movements
and interprets them as cursor control commands.Humanâ€“Computer Interface (HCI) can be described as the point of communication between the human user and a
computer. Commonly used input devices like: Keyboard, Mouse, Touchpad etc. All these devices require manual control and cannot be
used by persons impaired in movement capacity. 
## Tasks Performed ##

As we described above, this software would be built solely to help people who are physically disabled. And they are given below:
### Task 1: Login ###

Here user will login for entering to use this app.

### Task 2: Video ###

Opening webcam of device for detecting user's face expression.
### Task 3: Opening Mouth ###

By this expression user can activate or deactivate mouse control.
### Task 4: Right Eye Wink ###

This will help user to click right.

### Task 5: Left Eye Wink ###

This will help user to click left.
### Task 6: Squinting Eyes ###

For Activating/Deactivating scrolling mode.
### Task 7: Head Movement ###
By this user can move scrolling cursor.

### Task 8: Log Out ###

There will be log out option to exit the application.
## Platform that we will use ##

We use python and will use many libraries which will help to make this app like: Numpy, OpenCv, PyAutoGUI etc.
