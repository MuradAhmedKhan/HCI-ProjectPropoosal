#Phase 2: Narowing down the Application#

##Task Finalization##

Task 1: Login
Here user will login for entering to use this app. There is restriction that user can't login without creating his/her account, and in this we provide a mouse for to move it and can click by it. 

Task 2: Video
Opening webcam of device for detecting user's face expression. Here we will give facility to user that he/she can use mouse by moving face. It is important for crippled person(i.e Disable from hand)

##Target Audience##

Our target audience is all user disabled user who can't use computer or cannot interact with computer devices by his/her hands.

Many other questions. 

##Design Alternatives##
1) List down at-least 10 design alternatives.
2) Here we have personas, scenarios and storyboard regarding our project mouse controlling by face.
