#Phase 2: Narowing down the Application#

##Task Finalization##

Task 1: Login
Here user will login for entering to use this app. There is restriction that user can't login without creating his/her account, and in this we provide a mouse for to move it and can click by it.

##Target Audience##

Our target audience is all user disabled user who can't use computer or cannot interact with computer devices by his/her hands.

Many other questions. 

##Design Alternatives##

-LOGIN
1) Login button always be in center of screen to make it good.
2) Login button will be disable before putting values in textbox.
3) And also disabled when right input should entered like email has abc@xyz.com
4) Remember me option should available.
5) Keep me signed in option also available.

-Video
1) Video will be visible for user.
2) Video should has minimize option.
3) Language option should available when user wants to give input by voice.
4) We should have option to lock camera because whenever user doesn't interact with device the camera still taking input.
5) User should has lots of option by speaking input because user is disabled. so user should not need to move face to acccomplish task it's annoying.
